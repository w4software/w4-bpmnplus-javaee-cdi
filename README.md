w4-bpmnplus-javaee-cdi
======================

This project contains bindings for [Context And Dependency Injection (CDI)](http://cdi-spec.org/) technology defined in [JSR-346](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346).

It contains the factories that provide the ability to inject W4 BPMN+ Services in any CDI managed bean.


Download
--------

You can download the prebuild JAR file from the following location
 
 - [bpmnplus-cdi-9.2.0.0.jar](http://maven.w4store.com/repository/contrib/eu/w4/contrib/bpmnplus-cdi/9.2.0.0/bpmnplus-cdi-9.2.0.0.jar) 

If using maven, you can use the following dependency snippet in your POM.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>eu.w4.contrib</groupId>
      <artifactId>bpmnplus-cdi</artifactId>
      <version>9.2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

If not already done, you'll also need to reference our [maven repository](https://maven.w4store.com).


Usage
-----

### Configuration

Create a resource file named `w4bpmnplus.properties` at the root of your classpath, that will provide the connection parameters.

Any parameter defined in the enum class [NetworkConfigurationParameter](http://docs.w4store.com/9100/API/BP/javadocs/engineClient/eu/w4/engine/client/configuration/NetworkConfigurationParameter.html) can be used in this property file. It may look like the following:

    RMI__REGISTRY_HOST=localhost
    RMI__REGISTRY_PORT=7707

If the file is not found at runtime, W4 BPMN+ Engine on the default port of the local host will be used.

In a web-application, this file must be located in WEF-INF/classes directory of the WAR file (or webapplication folder).

In the source tree of of Maven project, this file must be in `src/main/resources`.



### Service Injection

In any CDI managed bean, you can use the following syntax

    public class MyBean {

        /* you can inject any W4 service */
        @Inject
        private ActivityService activityService;

        /* the object factory is also managed */
        @Inject
        private ObjectFactory objectFactory;

        /* here should lie the business code using the injected services */
    }
